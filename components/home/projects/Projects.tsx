          Datakirk is a talent matching platform for data professionals in the
          UK. This frontend was built solely by me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tech stack is based on top of React and Material ui, connected to
          a Python & Django backend, with data stored in Postgres, deployed on
          AWS.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users can sign up as either a company or a talent. Companies can
          search for talents based on skills, experience levels etc. Talents can
          also search for jobs posted by companies and apply various filters to
          the search. Talents can save the jobs they like to check out later.
