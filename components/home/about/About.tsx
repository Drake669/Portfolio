              Hi, Iâ€™m Evans. Iâ€™m a software engineer from Accra, Ghana with a
              strong focus on fullstack development, specializing in frontend
              technologies like React, Vue, and NextJS, while also working with
              backend tools such as Node.js, Express, and Golang.

              I currently work as a Fullstack Developer at Kwame AI, where I
              collaborate with AI and data engineers to build tools for legal
              professionals and students. My work includes creating a drafting
              feature for legal documents, implementing real-time AI streaming,
              and developing a WhatsApp-integrated bot that enables students to
              prepare for exams directly from their phones.

              Outside of work, I enjoy building personal projects such as a Go
              interpreter and backend systems, while also spending time
              configuring Neovim (yes, Iâ€™m that guy who loves reading
              documentation for new plugins).

              Iâ€™m seeking new opportunities where I can merge my love for
              building software with my curiosity for learning new technologies.
